# Sanctions-2011-and-felamles-LFP-in-Iran
Abstract
In the recent years Iranian femalesâ€™ education have increased dramatically with the decrease in 
their fertility rate. However; their participation in the labor market have not changed considerably. 
So, it seems that education and children is not a barrier for women employment in Iran anymore. 
However, since in Iran no controlled experiment is done to measure the effect of a program on 
LFP of women, we used sanctions of 2011 as an exogenous shock to run a DID estimate and 
measure its effect on LFP. This sanction affected manufacturing sector and decreased its GDP by 
near 18% in two years while it had little effect (or not any) on service sector. Using a panel data 
of Household expenditure and Income survey (HEIS) of families in Iran for the period of 2010-
2012, I made a treatment and a control group based on the sector that the husbands of a woman 
worked before sanctions: Manufacturing or Service. According to our findings, sanctions had a 
negative effect on women in treatment group (those whose husbands worked in manufacturing)
and reduced their LFP by about 2.5 pp. This negative effect was mostly driven by educated women 
such that LFP of women who have university degree was reduced by near 12 pp during sanctions
and had little effect or nothing on other women. The only positive effect that we saw during 
sanctions was among the neediest families who are at the bottom of income distribution for both 
our treatment and control group. According to our interpretation these women increased their LFP 
because their living expenses was increased due to the inflation during sanctions. In addition, we 
saw the negative effect just in rural areas and not in urban. Our finding tells us contrary to our 
expectations, women did not increase their participation with a bad income shock if they were not 
needy. Our interpretation is that women were discouraged to participate in the labor market during 
sanctions perhaps as a result of negative signals from the demand side of the labor market or 
because many of them lost their jobs. The policy implication is that for fostering women to 
participate in the labor market, we should also pay attention on the labor market and provide a 
better environment for them.
